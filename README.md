|       -       |   Subtraction  |

# User Interaction
The program takes a string with an arithmetic expression as an argument, evaluates it and returns the result when the user clicks on the equal button. 

If the expression string is not a valid arithmetic expression the formula is not updated and the user can  either reset the formula by clicking on the _all clear_ button or click on another button to enter a valid expression.
