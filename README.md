# Wildcard project
A basic calculator implemented in Javascript.

# Purpose and use of the program : include screenshot

# User Interaction
The program takes a string with an arithmetic expression as an argument, evaluates it and returns the result when the user clicks on the equal button.

If the expression string is not a valid arithmetic expression the formula is not updated and the user can  either:

- reset the formula by clicking on the _all clear_ button,
- click on an other button to enter a valid expression.

# Supported operators

The progran uses the same operator precedence and associativity as the javascript programming language and also supports the power operator.

| Operator      |  Description   |
| :-----------: |:--------------:|
|       +       |    Addition    |
|       -       |   Subtraction  |
|       *       | Multiplication |
|       /       |    Division    |
|       **      | Raise to power |
